# About this Program

*TEKLabeler* is a application used to generate HTML documents to be printed as labels for three goals:
1. Reduce the errors that the computer image deployer may make and streamline the process of imaging devices.
2. Assist the QA team to ensure proper inspection of the devices before packing and sending them out.
3. Allow the receiving end user know what devices to expect, what software they wanted, and their login information.
